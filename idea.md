Highly inspired by [Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator](<https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/>) (AFMG).

This project would be a series of console commands, and possible QGIS extensions, and other tools which make it easier to generate fantasy maps using GIS data.

# Reasoning

AFMG maps are a rectangle full of voronoi cells around randomly generated points. Each cell has an elevation, plus a number of other attributes, which make all land within that cell fairly uniform. In some ways this resembles hexagonal grid maps of role-playing games, and if you had uniform placement of points, it would look exactly like that. However, the random points and the voronoi give a more organic look to the output. With appropriate line smoothing and styling, the resulting maps look very much like a traditional fantasy map.

The problem with AFMG is that it is a monolithic tool inseparable from the user interface built around it. While the creator has added a lot of features and customization to the system, additional features and customization are dependent on their schedule and vision. Due to its development as a browser application, it suffers from performance problems with very complex maps. 

Implementing much of the functionality as commands around open geographic file formats would mean: 

1) No need to create a complex user interface. QGIS and other open mapping tools could be used to display the results, allowing me to focus on the algorithms.
2) The ability to use alternative data formats, and pull in data produced by custom tools into any point in the map generation process.
3) The ability to work with larger, more complex maps by utilizing optimizations built-in to GIS tools.

In addition, this would give me a chance to find ways to improve upon AFMG's algorithms. For example, AFMG creates flat maps. However, I believe that if the voronoi centers were generated correctly and the voronoi generation algorithm was based on projected metric distance instead of degrees, I would be able to create cells that are similar in area on a globe. This would make terrain processing algorithms more verisimilar.

# Development

I foresee this project not as a big monolithic processing script, but a series of smaller scripts that perform parts of the operation. It would also allow creating one master script which can easily generate a world similar to AFMG's "New Map" button.

These tools could be developed in a combination of python and rust. There are many geographic libraries available in rust, including code allowing access to common GIS file formats, and a binding library for GDAL. This would make development of command-line tools a breeze. Python, however, would be required to integrate some of these tools into QGIS as plugins and commands for its toolbox.

Alternatively, the tools could be developed entirely as python scripts for QGIS, however that would limit their usage to only those who wish to use QGIS. For that matter, I could develop all of the commands as python scripts, but I fear the maintenance of such tools.

# The Tools

At least at the start, the program will be a single, monolithic tool which handles individual command arguments to run different algorithms, or collections of algorithms. I believe this will allow quicker compilations when manipulating the back-end library code. It would also produce a smaller total file size, since copies of the shared code do not have to be copied into each separate program. Once it is working and working well, it could be separated into smaller programs that utilize a shared library, but that is a challenge for another time.

The name of the executable will be nfmt, which are initials that stand for "Neil's Fantasy Map Tools", or using my creative name, "N M Sheldon's Fantasy Map Tools".

I foresee the need for the following commands:

* `nfmt genesis`: the equivalent of the 'New Map' button on AFMG. It will create random terrain, and populate it with random states, and create a final set of maps and data all at once, including dissolved versions. There will be options for specifying some parameters for the world, but overall this won't be as flexible as running the commands separately. However, it may be enough.
* `nfmt convert-afmg`: This will convert GIS data from AFMG into formats used for NFMT. It may eventually be able to read a ".map" file, however that format is complex, poorly documented and probably subject to change.
* `nfmt create-terrain`: generates an NFMT Terrain file given world parameters and optional terrain templates. The templates will be reminiscent of similar templates used in AFMG, and may even take the same formats. There should be some built-in templates.
* `nfmt convert-heightmap`: generates an NFMT Terrain file given world parameters and a heightmap. Some of the world parameters might be taken from the heightmap.
* `nfmt convert-image`: generates an NFMT Terrain file given a graphic image, that converts based on hue in a similar manner to AFMG. This might be the same tool as `convert-heightmap`, but with some specific options. The purpose of this tool is mostly to allow the user to complete the same tasks as AFMG, which seems to be quite flexible on its input.
* `nfmt gen-climate`: generates climate information for an NFMT Terrain file (temperature and precipitation) given climate parameters. The simple algorithm that AFMG uses seems to assign temperatures based on latitude and elevation, and moisture based on latitudinal wind directions and distance from the ocean. A more complex climate model may be developed in the future.
* `nfmt import-climates`: given raster data classified with temperature and moisture data, and a similar extent as the NFMT Terrain file, applies their results to the terrain. This would allow generating climate data from some other tool.
* `nfmt gen-biomes`: this will take an NFMT Terrain file and an NFMT Biome file and generate biomes on the terrain file based on climate information already in it.
* `nfmt gen-water`: this will generate an NFMT Water file containing river and lake polygons for an NFMT Terrain file given climate information.
* `nfmt gen-people`: this takes an NFMT Terrain file, for which biomes have been generated, and populates it with people, creating random cultures, nations, cities, etc. This creates a bunch of accessory files by default, but some of these can be pre-created. Although this command does a lot, the process of generating these things is fairly interconnected, so it almost needs to be. There may be additional `gen-*` commands which will allow separating parts of this process into further steps, but only if I can actually divide it into steps.
* `nfmt gen-features`: this takes an terrain file with biomes and people, and generates interesting points of interest and regions for the world, equivalent to markers and zones in AFMG.
* `nfmt regen-*`: these commands regenerate specific entities (like cities, nations, etc.) for a given NFMT Terrain file, while keeping other entities the same as much as possible. These commands will also allow "locking" some entities, to prevent changes to those, or regenerating them only within specific areas of the map, such as a nation or a province.
* `nfmg dissolve`: this takes a Terrain map and dissolves it into various entity maps (biomes, states, provinces, etc.). An option would allow smoothing the lines, but preferably in a way that they match with coastlines and that provinces match with states. Essentially, this is the one that produces the final "product", from which you can then make nice maps.
* `nfmt submap`: this takes a viewport and world parameters and attempts to create an NFMT Terrain and auxiliary vector files for a smaller part of the world. If the original heightmap is provided, it uses that to help interpolate data for the smaller scale. Otherwise, it uses some randomization to create the illusion of more detailed cells.

# File Specifications

The NFMT tools which generate in parts can't work without being able to expect access to specific data in the input files. This creates a number of file "types", which aren't necessarily tied to specific formats. There are two basic formats for each file: 'vector files' and 'tables'. 

The files below have been given names representing a "standard" naming scheme, which makes it easier to tell where things are, and automatically find files. All commands should allow customizing these file names, but if not specified these will be the default. In the names below `<world>` represents the project or world name, and `<ext>` represents a compatible extension. When "discovering" files, an error will occur if multiple files are given with the same identifier but different supported extensions. A few items don't have names, these are generally configuration files which would be used for multiple worlds.

**Vector** This is a GDAL-supported vector-based GIS file or layer in a multi-layer file.

**Table** This is a file containing tabular data (columns and rows) in a format supported by NFMT. NFMT will support CSV files at the very least. It may support more files if these sorts of things are supported by GDAL.

* NFMT Terrain: (`<world>.terrain.<ext>`) vector containing polygons or multi-polygons and a number of expected fields. It's possible that some tools will add those fields if they do not exist. The four that are absolutely needed are a voronoi ID field, a NEIGHBORS field that lists the polygons that border this one, a numeric ELEVATION field, and a boolean IS_OCEAN field. Other fields represent climatic and political data for the world, which is uniform across a given cell. While the program is not able to detect this, it assumes the polygons are laid out in the voronoi format described earlier in this document.
* NFMT Water: (`<world>.freshwater.<ext>`)vector containing polygons that represent rivers and lakes.
* NFMT Towns: (`<world>.towns.<ext>`) vector containing points that represent the locations of towns (Burgs in AFMG). I understand why AFMG might have chosen burgs over cities, towns, etc. to avoid preconceived notions and regional government definitions. However, I feel the word "burg" is burdened by the same problems as those words, and in English the word "town" is the closest we have to a generic word for an urbanized area.
* NFMT Routes: (`<world>.routes.<ext>`) vector containing lines that represent routes between towns.
* NFMT Point Features: (`<world>.features-point.<ext>`) vector containing points that represent the locations of special features in a World. 
* NFMT Poly Features: (`<world>.features-poly.<ext>`) vector containing polygons that represent special regional features in a World.
* NFMT Labels: (`<world>.labels.<ext>`) vector containing points with labels and label types for displaying on the map. The points represent good places to put the labels. There might also be IDs to associate them with specific entities, so it's easier to update them when those entities are modified, without losing the point locations.
* NFMT Biomes: (`<world>.biomes.<ext>`) Table containing a list of biomes with ID, Name, Habitability, Temperature Range, and Precipitation range. The last two fields are used for finding biomes by climate. Habitability is used by `gen-people` to determine where people are living.
* NFMT Nations: (`<world>.nations.<ext>`) Table containing a list of nations (States in AFMG) with ID, Name, and some other important data. The IDs are used in the Terrain file to specify what nation controls that cell. I do not presume to know why AFMG chose the word state for this entity. While it works, it is an ambiguous term in the U.S, Australia and other nations with "states". Meanwhile, "state" implies a heavily organized system of government, whereas "nation" can have connotations of a group of people following similar cultural rules without necessarily having heavy organization. I like nation better.
* NFMT Provinces: (`<world>.provinces.<ext>`) Table containing a list of provinces with ID, Name and other data. The IDs are used in the Terrain file to specify what province a cell is in.
* NFMT Cultures: (`<world>.cultures.<ext>`) Table containing a list of cultures with ID, Name, and other data. The IDs are used in the Terrain file to specify what culture is predominant in a cell.
* NFMT Religions: (`<world>.religions.<ext>`) Table containing a list of religions with ID, Name, and other data. The IDs are used in the Terrain file to specify what religion is predominant in a cell.
* NFMT Name Bases: Table containing language names and lists of words and other parameters for generating names for places. Note that NFMT might be able to work with my other project, Elbie, to generate names. The Name Bases are used to generate names using similar algorithms to AFMG.
* NFMT Culture Sets: Table containing information for randomly generating sets of cultures. This might be more than just a table. This is something that is built into AFMG and not configurable, but I feel it's important to be able to configure this.
* NFMT Dissolved Files: these vectors represent dissolved, and possibly smoothed data, as created by the `--dissolve` command.
    * `<world>.dissolved-elevation.<ext>`
    * `<world>.dissolved-ocean.<ext>`
    * `<world>.dissolved-biomes.<ext>`
    * `<world>.dissolved-nations.<ext>`
    * `<world>.dissolved-provinces.<ext>`
    * `<world>.dissolved-cultures.<ext>`
    * `<world>.dissolved-religions.<ext>`

# Configuration

There are two ways of configuring a command: command-line operations and configuration files. Configuration files will be generally written in JSON, and passed with a single parameter to each command. When processing configuration, later configuration values override earlier ones, whether the source was a command-line or a file.

Some configuration options include:

* `seed`: A number to use to seed random number generators. NFMT should be designed so that if the seed is provided, it will always return the same results for the same input, given the same version of a program. This aids testing and allows the user more control over the results.
* `cells`: An integer indicating the number of voronoi cells to generate when creating Terrain maps. The more there are, the more detailed the map, and the more processor intensive.
* `epoch`: An enum representing different types of worlds and technology levels for use in `gen-people` and related tools. AFMG seems to always generate cultures which might fit into a period 16th-19th centuries of Earth. It is not possible to limit it to stone or bronze age cultures, for example, where naval cultures do not extend anywhere near as far and non-agricultural societies are much more numerous.
* `cultures`: An integer representing the number of cultures to generate.
* `nations`: An integer representing the number of nations to generate.
* `provinces-ratio`: An integer representing the average number of provinces to generate per nation. I'm not certain how to do this correctly, as that number may depend on the government and size of the nation.

There may be numerous other options, including some numbers set under `Options` and `Units` in AFMG. However, as the algorithms I'm using may differ, and some of those values are used for the UI, I can't be certain until I develop the algorithms what parameters I'll actually need.

# Algorithm Improvements

For the most part, AFMG is open source, and I can use some of the same algorithms as a basis for my code. However, there are a few things I know I will change:

## Equal-Area Voronoi Cells

AFMG creates flat maps. This format hides the fact that the areas of cells near the poles are significantly smaller than the cells near the equator. This automatically creates a bias towards generating nations closer to the poles, which is not verisimilar.

While I can't make the voronoi cells exactly the same area without creating a hexagonal grid map, I could try to place the points so that the areas of each cell are similar to each other on the globe. This means, placing less points in the upper latitudes. I am not yet sure how to do this, but this might be doable by taking a subset of points on a rectangular extent that would fit into a shape similar to some pseudocylindrical projection, such as Mollweide. These points would then be stretched out from the east and west by some standard formula to fill the rectangle.

The results of such a map will look very strange in am equirectanguilar projection, due to colors stretching east-west near the poles, and straighter coasts and boundary lines in those areas. I could overcome this by using something that's not a true voronoi. Take the original voronoi generated over a rectangular area, and calculate new shapes by dissolving them by which stretched voronoi their center points lay in, creating more organic edges to the higher latitude cells. 

Something like this could also be used to get around another problem with AFMG: uniformly smooth borders. If the original rectangular voronoi created more points in areas of higher relief, this could be used to create rougher looking cells in those areas in the final map.

Another requirement for this system is a way to knit the wrapped edges together when the map represents an entire world. The cells on the edges need to wrap around 180 W, so that elevations, rivers and political continuums meet appropriately. To create these sorts of voronoi, you would probably need to "repeat" the easternmost points transformed to just beyond the western edge (or vice versa). And then, after that is all done, somehow merge them together. The boundaries of the map still need to be rectangular, so the merged cells then have to be split by the anti-prime-meridian line. This probably requires the cells to be multipolygons instead.

## Elevationless Ocean

Land below sea level exists. NFMG does not define its ocean based on a specific elevation, but marks it as a property of the terrain cell, allowing for mid-Messinnian Mediterranean-style seas, or at least Death Valley. Whether such things get generated, however, or is only available in imported heightmaps, is not for me to say at this point.

## Climate Models

The climate model used by AFMG is simplistic. Although I could play around with it more, one noticeable problem is the lack of distinct climates from west and east coast. I think at first I will use the algorithm as straight as I can get it from AFMG. Eventually, however, I want something that at least looks at air pressure for generating winds. I'm just not going to go as for as using a real climate model tool. However, the tools as above should be enough to be able to pull in that kind of data if available.

## People Models

I don't know the details of AFMG's algorithms for generating political features. I don't know if there's something I can improve. I just know that it outputs results that seem odd sometimes. I have to play around with the assumptions for these, maybe what AFMG has are more sufficient than I'm seeing.

One thing I will change, are the "types" of cultures. I will also add the ability to filter out types depending on an epoch or world type. AFMG has "generic", "river", "lake", "naval", "nomadic", "hunting", and "highland". I'm surprised there is no "agricultural" or "industrial" culture type, and I'm not sure what a "highland" culture would be, short of men in kilts. In addition, "naval" cultures in the 19th century are much different from naval cultures in the 1st century, and in earlier ages those cultures shouldn't even be generated. Finally, I feel like a "wildlands" culture is unlikely -- it should be filled in with all sorts of nomadic and hunting cultures instead -- at best there might be a frontier culture of sorts which combines two or more cultures together. There should also be some fantasy cultures: Elves who actually prefer to live in forests, and Dwarves who actually want to build cities in mountains. And creatures whose real homes are underground, or underwater.

# AFMG Algorithms

## Generating Voronoi

`generateGrid`:
```
function generateGrid() {
  Math.random = aleaPRNG(seed); // reset PRNG // NMS: Appears to be a random number generator
  const {spacing, cellsDesired, boundary, points, cellsX, cellsY} = placePoints();
  const {cells, vertices} = calculateVoronoi(points, boundary);
  return {spacing, cellsDesired, boundary, points, cellsX, cellsY, cells, vertices, seed};
}
```

`placePoints`: `graphWidth` and `graphHeight` appear to be the width and height of the canvas
```
function placePoints() {
  TIME && console.time("placePoints");
  const cellsDesired = +byId("pointsInput").dataset.cells; // NMS: This is `Options` > `Points Number`
  const spacing = round(Math.sqrt((graphWidth * graphHeight) / cellsDesired), 2); // spacing between points before jirrering

  const boundary = getBoundaryPoints(graphWidth, graphHeight, spacing);
  const points = getJitteredGrid(graphWidth, graphHeight, spacing); // points of jittered square grid
  const cellsX = Math.floor((graphWidth + 0.5 * spacing - 1e-10) / spacing);
  const cellsY = Math.floor((graphHeight + 0.5 * spacing - 1e-10) / spacing);
  TIME && console.timeEnd("placePoints");

  return {spacing, cellsDesired, boundary, points, cellsX, cellsY};
}
```

`getBoundaryPoints`
```
function getBoundaryPoints(width, height, spacing) {
  const offset = rn(-1 * spacing);
  const bSpacing = spacing * 2;
  const w = width - offset * 2;
  const h = height - offset * 2;
  const numberX = Math.ceil(w / bSpacing) - 1;
  const numberY = Math.ceil(h / bSpacing) - 1;
  const points = [];

  for (let i = 0.5; i < numberX; i++) {
    let x = Math.ceil((w * i) / numberX + offset);
    points.push([x, offset], [x, h + offset]);
  }

  for (let i = 0.5; i < numberY; i++) {
    let y = Math.ceil((h * i) / numberY + offset);
    points.push([offset, y], [w + offset, y]);
  }

  return points;
}
```

`getJitteredGrid`
```
function getJitteredGrid(width, height, spacing) {
  const radius = spacing / 2; // square radius
  const jittering = radius * 0.9; // max deviation
  const doubleJittering = jittering * 2;
  const jitter = () => Math.random() * doubleJittering - jittering;

  let points = [];
  for (let y = radius; y < height; y += spacing) {
    for (let x = radius; x < width; x += spacing) {
      const xj = Math.min(rn(x + jitter(), 2), width);
      const yj = Math.min(rn(y + jitter(), 2), height);
      points.push([xj, yj]);
    }
  }
  return points;
}
```

`calculateVoronoi`
```
function calculateVoronoi(points, boundary) {
  TIME && console.time("calculateDelaunay");
  const allPoints = points.concat(boundary);
  const delaunay = Delaunator.from(allPoints);
  TIME && console.timeEnd("calculateDelaunay");

  TIME && console.time("calculateVoronoi");
  const voronoi = new Voronoi(delaunay, allPoints, points.length);

  const cells = voronoi.cells;
  cells.i = createTypedArray({maxValue: points.length, length: points.length}).map((_, i) => i); // array of indexes
  const vertices = voronoi.vertices;
  TIME && console.timeEnd("calculateVoronoi");

  return {cells, vertices};
}
```

# Tasks

To proceed on this, I can break it down into the following steps:

[X] Command line application that handles commands and configuration (start with "version" and "help"). 
[X] Need Usage/Documentation as well..
[ ] `convert-heightmap` command -- Doing this first allows me to play with pre-existing terrains for the rest of it.
    [X] Create Points
    [X] Delaunay Regions
    [X] Voronoi Regions
    [X] validate the output
    [ ] compare to QGIS voronoi functions
        [X] One option that might work: 
            [X] Make sure there are four "infinity" points (when generating the delaunay) at (-width,-height),(-width,2*height),(2*width,2*height),(2*width,-height)
            [X] Clamp the random points to within the extents.
            [X] When we get to the voronoi
                [X] check if site is outside the extent, and don't generate a voronoi for that.
                [X] Otherwise, check if any vertices of the voronoi are outside the extent, and if so clip them (create an extent geography and use an intersection, perhaps? Or, just find the intersection and do it?)
    [X] Need density instead of spacing. Right now, spacing doesn't increment across the map, especially if you specify it. There are other problems with that, but that's at least one of them. 
    [X] Trim voronoi to within the extent (will require an extent on the voronoi dev command).
        [X] Okay, I need to move the border points along the border instead of outside it, otherwise, I can't sample for voronoi on the edge.
        This broke the voronoi, I'm not certain why. I don't guarantee it's not a problem with my voronoi code, however. I'm going to revisit this tomorrow.
        What if I got rid of the borders, and just spread the points across and clamped them within the extents? -- See the thing about trimming below
        [X] If the boundary dots are all outside extent, and regulated, but the random are all inside, I believe we should be able to easily identify sites that don't belong. Then, if circumcenter is outside, we can just find an intersection between the line and the extent edge.
    [ ] Figure out neighbors. The idea of tracking triangles doesn't work, at least partly because the circumcenter of a triangle may not be inside the triangle. So, I'm going to have to do a separate process for getting the neighbors.
        * I believe this is a close enough answer, and as it is probably using gdal, it works: https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/find_neighbor_polygons.html
        * Essentially, you iterate through each feature, create a bounding box around it, then look for features that fit inside the bounding box, and check
          each of those if they are not disjoint.
        * There's a function called set_spatial_feature on the layer that can help.
        * As this works closely with GDAL (I'm not going to implement it using my own types), it might be a function on the tile layer.
    [ ] Sample heights from heightmap
    [ ] add Ocean Mask option vs ocean elevation.
[ ] `gen-climate` command
    [ ] Review AFMG climate generation algorithms and add them -- we'll wait on improved algorithms until later
    [ ] Figure out whether we're overwriting or creating new processed Terrain files, and if the latter, come up with a default naming scheme so the `genesis` command can leave the working files, and it is easy to "find" files when working with the other tools. Maybe there's a "project" file which is automatically updated? Or, maybe the required layers are required parameters, and can be specified with a configuration file, with an option to update that file after running commands.
[ ] `gen-biomes` command
    [ ] Biome file
    [ ] Review AFMG biome generation algorithms
[ ] `gen-water` command
    [ ] Water file
    [ ] Review AFMG river generation algorithm
[ ] `gen-people` command
    [ ] various auxiliary files
    [ ] Review AFMG people generation algorithms -- again, wait on improvements until later
    [ ] Figure out how to break the task apart into sub commands and create those commands.
[ ] Improved, Similar-area voronoization algorithm vaguely described above
[ ] Figure out how to compile and deploy this tool to various operating systems. At least arch linux and windows.
[ ] Announce beta release on Blog, Mammoth, Reddit (AFMG list, imaginarymapping, a few other places), and start updating those places when changes are made.
    -- I feel like having all the above is enough to announce, as long as "creating terrain", a large task, will be the next thing on the list.
[ ] `create-terrain` commands
    [ ] terrain template files
    [ ] Review AFMG terrain generation algorithms
[ ] Improved climate generation commands
[ ] Improved people generation commands
[ ] `gen-features` command
    [ ] Various auxiliar files
    [ ] Review AFMG markers and zones algorithm
[ ] `regen-*` commands
    [ ] Based on what is done in `gen-people` and some other things, but keep things that shouldn't be regenerated.
[ ] `dissolve` commands
[ ] `genesis` command
[ ] Start working on QGIS scripts and tools and a plugin for installing them.
[ ] `convert-afmg` command -- for now, just convert CSV and GeoJSON exports. Don't worry and probably don't plan to support the ".map" file.
[ ] `submap` command
[ ] `convert-image` command if I can't just use convert-heightmap
[ ] `import-climates` command
