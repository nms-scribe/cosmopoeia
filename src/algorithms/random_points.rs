        What I want it to do here is increase spacing depending on the line of latitude. Think of the intial spacing as being
        in units of 1 degree at the equator. The spherical length of that spacing does not change, but it's ratio to the length
        of the latitude does. 

        So, what I want is a ratio of the length of the equator to the specified line of latitude. This will be the ratio that the spacing increases by.
            R = Le/L(phi)
            where: 
                Le is the length of the equator
                L(phi) is the length of a given line of latitude

        The length of the equator is constant 360 degrees.

        The length of a degree of longitude at a given latitude is:
            L = (π/180) * a * cos(phi)
            where: 
                a is the radius of the sphere
                phi is the latitude

        There are 360 degrees of longitude in a line of latitude. So, the length of a line of latitude is:
            L = (π/180) * 360 * a * cos(phi)
            L = 2π * a * cos(phi)
        
        I don't have a radius. But I do have the circumference. Since I'm measuring these values in degrees, the circumference of the world is 360. And I can get the radius from that:
            a = C / (2 * π)
            a = 360 / (2 * π)
            a = 180 / π

        Now, solve for L given that value for a:
            L = 2π * (180 / π) * cos(phi)
            L = 2 * 180 * cos(phi)
            L = 360 * cos(phi)

        Finally, we have the ratio:
            R = 360/L
            R = 360/(360 * cos(phi))
            R = 1/cos(phi)
